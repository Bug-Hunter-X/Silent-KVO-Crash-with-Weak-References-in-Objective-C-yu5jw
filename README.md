This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Objective-C related to Key-Value Observing (KVO) and weak references.  The `BuggyKVO.m` file shows how improper handling of KVO can lead to crashes when an observed object deallocates before the observer removes itself. The solution (`FixedKVO.m`) provides a robust approach to prevent these crashes.  This is a common error that can be hard to debug due to its intermittent and often-delayed nature. The code showcases the problem and provides a clear and concise solution.
